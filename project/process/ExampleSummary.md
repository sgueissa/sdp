# Summary for sprint 4

## Bernadetta

I had to duplicate a fair bit of code while implementing a new login method, as I had not thought of how to reuse the code for existing login methods beforehand.

In hindsight, I should have started with a quick design of how the new university authentication system differs from our existing Google authentication, and what code they could share.
I will pay more attention to the existing code for my next tasks.

On a positive note, my time estimate was very accurate, way better than the previous sprints! This is probably because I also implemented the other login method, so I knew what it entailed.


## Caspar

I realized too late that the "show itinerary" feature I was tasked with could not be implemented quickly because the service we use for the map does not support it, which is not documented.

In hindsight, I should not have left this to the last minute.
Next time I have to implement an entirely new feature, I'll begin with a quick prototype to make sure it is feasible with the libraries we already use,
to leave time to discuss with the team if it doesn't work.


## Dorothea

I found a library that did exactly what we wanted for our "filter and search" feature, so it only took me a couple of hours instead of being work for the entire sprint!

While this was a positive, my decision to then take the topmost task from the product backlog and work on it was not good, as Caspar could've used my help on the itinerary feature.
Next time I'm in this situation, I will instead ask the team if there is something I could help with.


## Ferdinand

I had no particular problems this sprint.
If anything, I believe I should pick a harder task next time, as my work this sprint was not very challenging.


## Hubert (Scrum Master)

I did not manage to implement either of my tasks due to other projects keeping me too busy.
On the positive side, I did have time to prepare a demo for the app, including some of the new features.

In hindsight, I should not have committed to doing so many things in the same week.
Next time, I will manage my time better to avoid spending all of it on something else.


## Petra

I finished my task, but had a stressful few hours at the end of the sprint as I had to update my code to handle new features merged by others.

In hindsight, I worked alone the entire sprint and missed our standup meeting due to another commitment.
Next time, I will coordinate more with the rest of the team, and plan my time so I do not miss our standup meetings.


## Overall team

We implemented almost all of the user stories we had assigned to this sprint, and we believe the remaining ones are still high-priority and should stay.

Our time estimates are getting better, and this sprint we did not have any major problems due to them, unlike last sprint.

However, we only did one standup meeting at the beginning of the sprint, which was not enough since Petra was blindsided by new work to do
and Dorothea was not aware that her freed time could have been put to better use.
